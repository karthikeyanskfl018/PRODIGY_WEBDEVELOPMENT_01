# PRODIGY_WEBDEVELOPMENT_PROJECT
Develop an adaptive landing page with an interactive navigation menu that dynamically alters its color or style based on scrolling or when a menu item is hovered over. The navigation menu should maintain a fixed position, ensuring visibility across all pages. Employ HTML for structural elements, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to introduce interactivity, such as modifying the background color or font color of the menu during scrolling or when a menu item is being hovered over.
